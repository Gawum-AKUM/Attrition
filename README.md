In this project, we used R to explore a company’s HR dataset by analyzing the distribution of each of the attributes, and then evaluated how each attribute could affect the dependent variable (employees’ likelihood to leave the company).
Built a logistic regression model that helped classify the attributes in decreasing order of likelihood to affect resignation. To conclude, a Machine Learning model was built to predict likelihood to resign, and a confusion matrix was developed to test the efficiency of the model.
